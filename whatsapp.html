        <h2>WhatsApp</h2>
        <p>WhatsApp was created back in 2009 by Jan Koum and Brian Acton. Currently, WhatsApp is now owned by Facebook who bought it in 2017. It is estimated that Facebook made â‚¬1.2 billion from WhatsApp in 2018. Since then WhatsApp has grown to be the most widely used app to text and call for free with internet.</p>

        <h3>How can it help in Education</h3>
        <p>As I discussed with Messenger, WhatsApp shares many similiar features to it. Creating group chats were students and teachers could talk to one another about homework or assignments that they are unsure about. This then helps stimulate collaborative work between classes and achieves an improvement of work ethic between students, teachers and even the whole school and college department. You can also share screenshots of briefs or instructions you missed. WhatsApp can connect you to anyone and anywhere; when contacting companies for future employment you can use WhatsApp for live video chats or exchange times for meetings.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although its provides all sorts of advanatages it can also be a distraction from work as you may get with contact with friends and miss out or not finish any work you have been given.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How to set up an account</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the app on IOS or Android in the app store.</li>
            <li>Click on the app and let WhatsApp connect to your contacts.</li>
            <li>Fill out your name and pick a profile picture for your profile and your done! (You can connect your Facebook account to your WhatsApp if you prefer).</li>
        </ol>
