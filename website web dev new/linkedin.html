        <h2>LinkedIn</h2>
        <p>LinkedIn is the world's largest professional online network with more than 120 million members and is growing rapidly. LinkedIn is a free professional social networking site that enables connections with trusted professional contacts to exchange knowledge, ideas and opportunities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>LinkedIn shares many similiar features with a lot of Social Media tools such as Instagram, Facebook etc. when creating a profile, adding friends and creating group chats to talk to multiple friends or family.
        Unlike them though LinkedIn is strictly used for a professional level in business. Connecting to low or high level companies and contacting them about design ideas and inventions that you have that can help the company. Or like Indeed it can be used to seek out employment positions.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How can it help in Education?</h3>
        <p>This applies more to college students as it would handle more full-time or internship employment. LinkedIn is like your virtual CV that is more detailed and explains a lot more of your traits to businesses. To learn how to work with LinkedIn is practiced well in collegs so that you will have experience once you finish your course and are ready to seek a job or an opportunity in self-work where companies look for say "you to create a website and they will pay" only a once off enlistment.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>How to set up a account</h3>
