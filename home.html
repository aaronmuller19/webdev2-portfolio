        <h2 class="line" >What is Social Media</h2>
        <p>Social Media today takes up the lives of many and has its advantages and disadvantages towards a person's life. Firstly starting with the internet in the late 70's which helped people find any information on any topic by the click of a button. Today however, social media  has developed, from having a huge computer to a small mobile device. Applications where brought in to make it easier to access a particular website.Today these social media tools are used to connect with family and friends.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="line" >Social Media in Education</h2>
        <p>Social Media is widely used mostly by teens; who are in school or college. They are seen as a distraction by most but for them it is a tool to use for answers of difficult questions and  problems that are given in classwork or assignments. There are many advantages and disadvantages as stated like how you can contact friends about pieces of the work you missed as you were sick or even email a teacher about a problem you can't understand. There is a wide range of uses that can provide help to people but many disagree. As the world as grown with these tools it has become part of their lives and has caused many people to be constantly on these apps which affects their education. This website will discuss about how social media tools can help everyone students and teachers in education.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The main thing that the website will cover is the advantages and disadvantages as there are many. These tools are great for reminders but also pose the threat of a distraction from work.</p>
        
        <h2 class="line" >Different Opinions</h2>
            <br>
        <p>When it comes to Social Media the first thing that comes to mind is a mobile phone. As a college student, I have experienced and seen what it is like to get distracted on my phone, but I have also been getting a lot of support on my phone that keeps me up to date with work especially during the Covid-19 pandemic which has caused a lot of problems for me in my studies. The constant contact with classmates has kept me in order with assignments I have been given throughout this time and emailing my tutors. That is my opinion how these tools have helped me in my education</p>
        <br>
        <p>However I have heard different opinions on Social Media especially from the older generation. Teachers and parents are really against Social Media; I know a big sterotype but it is also true as they solved answers and problems by turning to books instead of the internet or even to be patient during the beginnings of the internet to wait for information to be passed on.</p>
